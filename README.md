# Computer-Vision
This repository is shared for project assignments. The project will use the develop branch and merges to master should be pull requested and reviewed by the other member prior to merging into master.

## Subdirectories 
Each assignment directory should have /_data and /_output directories. The /_data directory is where the images being used for 
testing are stored and the /_ouput direcotry is the directory that any written files (files that any script saves) should be 
stored. the <code>.gitignore</code> file ignores these directories and this will alleviate any problems with having to change
read and write functions on a regular basis.
