# Computer-Vision
The Computer-Vision repository consists of four assignments from a course in computer vision. The four directories are 
- Assignment 1
- Assignment 2
- Assignment 3
- Assignment 4

## Assignment 1 
The Assginment 1 directory contains source code to familiarize oneself with functions and MATLAB scripts as well as MATLAB’s image processing toolbox.  This directory also contains a simple and naïve script to produce a checkerboard pattern image. 

## Assignment 2
The Assignment 2 directory contains an image filtering implementation called <code>my_imfilter.m</code>.  This function takes and image and a filter and convolves the image with the given filter.  The other files in this directory are simply tests and ways to use the <code>my_imfilter.m</code> function.   

## Assignment 3
The Assignment 3 directory contains five edge detection implementations, which MATLAB already supports.  However, these implementations may be used as a learning mechanism in understanding how edge detection implementations.  The implementations are 
-	<code>my_edgeCanny.m</code> (Canny edge detection)
-	<code>my_edgeLaplacian.m</code> (Laplacian edge detection)
-	<code>my_edgeMarrHildreth.m</code> (Marr-Hildreth edge detection)
-	<code>my_edgePrewitt.m</code> (Prewitt edge detection)
-	<code>my_edgeSobel.m</code> (Sobel edge detection)

## Assignment 4
The Assignment 4 directory contains a feature detecting function called <code>get_interest_points.m</code> Again, MATLAB provides many functions to achieve feature detection and this crude implementation is a tool to understand the feature detection process in images.
